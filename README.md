# Hybrid Modeling Framework

Despite advances in oncology, cancer persists as a major global health burden, with treatment efficacy often limited by incomplete understanding of its multiscale dynamics spanning tissues, cells, and molecular processes. To address this challenge, we develop a high-fidelity hybrid multiscale model that combines continuous descriptions at the tissue and molecular levels with a discrete individual-based approach at the cellular scale. To optimize chemotherapy treatment within this multiscale framework, we first derive a low-fidelity surrogate model using a data-driven approach integrating Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and global sensitivity analysis (SA). This reduced model enables efficient application of optimal control techniques for treatment optimization. Our framework provides a promising strategy for designing effective therapeutic protocols while minimizing drug toxicity in multiscale cancer scenarios.
